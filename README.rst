Since in the 2006 GRASS developers start to adopt python for the new GUI, python becoming more and more important and developers plan to convert all the bash script in to python for the next major release GRASS 7.

``pygrass`` want to improve integration between GRASS and python, make the use of python under GRASS more consistent with the language itself and make the GRASS scripting and programming activity easier and more natural to the final users.

This project has been funded with support from the google Summer of Code 2012.
